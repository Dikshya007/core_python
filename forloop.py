"""
A for loop is also called an iterative loop in Python.
The for loop works based on a collection data structure, meaning 
that the for loop operates only on collections (such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets)
Syntax:
for variable_name in <collection>:
    action
"""
# list1=['Jyoti','Tapsu','Gita','Lidiya','Supriya']
# for name in list1:
#     print(name,'is present')

# tuple1=('Tapsu','Jyoti','Denisha')
# for name in tuple1:
#     print(name,'is beautiful')

# dict2={'Nepal':'KTM','China':'Beijing','India':'Delhi','Bhutan':'Thimpu','boy':True,'girls':False, 7:9}
# for key1 in dict2:
#     print(key1)

# for key,content in dict2.items():
#     print(key, content)

for rep in range(0,12):
    print(rep)
